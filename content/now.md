Hi, I'm Sid. This is my [now page](https://nownownow.com/about). 

Here's what I'm up to:
- Working as a security engineer at AWS (Vulnerability Management).
- Reading â€“ recent favorites: [The Anxious Generation](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/171681821-the-anxious-generation), [Political Tribes](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35628594-political-tribes), [The Atlantic](https://www.theatlantic.com) (magazine), and random stuff from [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com).
- Hiking around Western Washington.

And here's what I'm working toward:
- Developing my technical skills (w.r.t. security and building on AWS) to level up my career.
- Exploring and appreciating more of the Pacific Northwest.

It's almost New Year; these are some things I hope to accomplish in 2025:
- Read >12 books.
- [Cycle around Lake Washington](https://www.strava.com/routes/5153354) twice consecutively.
- Publish something insightful here.

Purpose of this site:
- I want to learn. Publishing openly forces me to more deeply understand what I'm writing about (even if what I share gets no visibility).
- I like to tinker. I created this with [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md), [Hugo](https://gohugo.io), [Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com), and [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com) ([repo](https://github.com/swlacy/swlacy.com)).
